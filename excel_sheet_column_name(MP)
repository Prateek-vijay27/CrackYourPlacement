We know in general number system of suppose base-26 should have 26 characters which represents values 0 to 25. But in Excel sheet column title this is little different. It represents values from 1 to 26. So if we use characters A-Z as 0-25, then it will look like below equation:

Let string be ABZ, this is corresponding to number n:
n = (A+1) * 26^2 + (B+1) * 26^1 + (Z+1) * 26^0

Why (A+1)? Because in char system ‘A’ is 0, but in excel system ‘A’ is one. Every char get an extra one.

So in order to get last char i.e. Z we would first minus 1 i.e. n– and then get n%26
(n-1)%26 = Z
Now divide with 26 and repeat same process for next character.
(n-1)/26 = (A+1) * 26^1 + (B+1) * 26^0
