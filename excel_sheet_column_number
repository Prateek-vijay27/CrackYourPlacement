Given a string columnTitle that represents the column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 




Approach: The process is similar to binary to decimal conversion. 
For example, to convert AB, the formula is 26 * 1 + 2. 
As another example, 
 

To convert CDA,
3*26*26 + 4*26 + 1

So it is very much similar to converting binary to decimal keeping the base as 26. 




class Solution {
    public int titleToNumber(String columnTitle) {
        int result =0;
        for(int i=0;i<columnTitle.length();i++)                time - O(n) n is length of input string               space -O(1)
        {
            result = result*26;
          result = result +  (columnTitle.charAt(i) -'A'+1);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
