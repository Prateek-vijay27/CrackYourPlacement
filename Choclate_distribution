Choclate distribution problem
  
  class Solution
{
    public long findMinDiff (ArrayList<Integer> a, int n, int m)
    {
        // your code here
        Collections.sort(a);
        int diff=0;
        long min_diff=Integer.MAX_VALUE;   
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {  if(m-1+i<n) 
             {
               diff=a.get(m-1+i)-a.get(i);
               if(diff<min_diff)
               min_diff=diff;
             }
             else return min_diff;
        }
        return min_diff;
    }
}

steps-:
1) sorting the given Arraylist
2) intializing two variables 
   i) int diff= contains the diffrence of frist and last element of m size array
    ii) min_diff= contains the minimum diffrence from the value of diff
3) in loop taking the diffrence between first and last element of 'm' size array
    if this diffrence is less than min_diff then updating min_diff by the 
     value of diff
4) return min_diff;
